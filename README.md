# Vigenère Cipher
This project demonstrates an automation for encrypting and decrypting a message using the Vigenère cipher, a method of polyalphabetic substitution.

# Project Overview
The goal of the project was to implement a program that:
- encrypts plaintext messages using a user-specified key
- decrypts cyphertext messages
- handles messages of arbitrary lengths
- provides a simple interface for users to interact with

# Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** getpass, string
